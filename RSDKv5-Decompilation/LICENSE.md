# RSDKv5(U) DECOMPILATION SOURCE CODE LICENSE v2

The code in this repository is a decompilation of RSDK (Retro-Engine) version 5 and 5-Ultimate.
There is original code in this repo, but most of the code is to be functionally the same as the version of RSDK this repo specifies.

This code is provided as-is, that is to say, without liability or warranty. 
Original authors of RSDK and authors of the decompilation are not held responsible for any damages or other claims said.

You may copy, modify, contribute, and distribute, for public or private use, **as long as the following are followed:**
- All pre-built executables provided TO ANYONE *PRIVATE OR OTHERWISE* **must be built with DLC disabled by __default.__**
  - DLC is managed by the DummyCore Usercore. A define, `RSDK_AUTOBUILD`, is already provided for you to force DLC off. 
  - Creating a configuration setting *is allowed,* so long as it is set to off by default.
    - *No such configuration will be pushed to the master repository.*
  - This is to ensure an extra layer of legal protection for Mania Plus.
- You may not use the decompilation for commercial (any sort of profit) use.
- You must clearly specify that the decompilation and original code are not yours: the developers of both must be credited.
- You may not distribute assets used to run any game not directly provided by the repository (other than unique, modded assets).
- This license must be in all modified copies of source code, and all forks must follow this license.
